   By gnulib convention, SIZE_MAX represents overflow in size
   calculations, so the conservative dividend to use here is
   SIZE_MAX - 1, since SIZE_MAX might represent an overflowed value.
   However, malloc (SIZE_MAX) fails on all known hosts where

   exactly-SIZE_MAX allocations on such hosts; this avoids a test and
